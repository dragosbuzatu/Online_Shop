In my Spring MVC project, I structured the application using key design principles and best practices:

Models: Defined core domain objects using JPA for database mapping.
DTOs: Used to transfer data between layers, ensuring separation of concerns.
Design Patterns: Implemented Repository, Service, and Controller patterns for clean architecture.
Repositories: Leveraged Spring Data JPA for database operations, with interfaces extending JpaRepository.
Controllers: Handled HTTP requests and mapped them to service methods, annotated with @RestController.
Services: Contained business logic and acted as intermediaries between controllers and repositories.
Authentication and Authorization: Implemented JWT for authentication and Bearer tokens for securing API endpoints.
